## How to Install Mondoo Agent

We provide the Mondoo binaries via our [release page](https://releases.mondoo.io/mondoo/). While you can install the binary manually, we recommend the automated methods since they implement best-practices:

- [Bash Script](bash.md) or [Cloudinit](cloudinit.md) (recommended)
- [Ansible](ansible.md) (recommended)
- [Chef](chef.md) (recommended)

If you need to install the agent manually, the following instructions illustrate the workflow.

- System Package manager
  - [RedHat/CentOS](redhat.md)
  - [Ubuntu](ubuntu.md)
  - [Amazon Linux](amazonlinux.md)
  - [Suse/openSUSE](suse.md)
  - [macOS](macos.md)
  - [Windows](windows.md)
- [Binaries](binaries.md)
