## Binary Download

Mondoo distributes binaries for Windows. To install agent, download the [appropriate package](https://releases.mondoo.io/mondoo/). Archives for Windows systems use `.zip`. After the download is complete, extract the content. The Mondoo agent is a single binary named `mondoo`. The last step is to add the `mondoo` binary to the path. You can configure the path via the control panel:

1. Go to `Control Panel` -> `System` -> `System settings` -> `Environment Variables`
2. In section `System variables` scroll down until you find `Path`.
3. Click edit and add the new path, make sure you split paths vis semicolon i.e. `C:\path1;C:\path2`
5. Launch a new console to take changes in effects
